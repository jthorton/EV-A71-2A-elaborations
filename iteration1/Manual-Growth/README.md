# Manual growing with FEGrow
We attempted to merge fragments x0556 and x0310 picking up all key interactions but replacing the 5 membered ring with 
a 6 member ring which had more elaborations in arthor. The reference compound had an predicted affinity of 7uM 
(gnina scoring function).

# Results

Using the manual grown molecule as a reference we then grew and scored each of the hits using FEGrow.
