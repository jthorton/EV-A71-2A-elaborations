# x1097_x0310-Elaborations

FEGrow was used to grow and score elaborations based on x1097 & x0310 extracted from Enamine real.

## Design details

- Reference ligands: x1097,x0310
- Crystal structure used: x0310

## Files
- [x1097_x0310.html.zip](x1097_x0310.html.zip): An interactive html report which can be sorted by predicted affinity or ic50(nM).
- [x1097_x0310.sdf.zip](x1097_x0310.sdf.zip): Contains the best 100 molecules sorted by predicted ic50(nM).
- [x1097-x0310_available.sdf.zip](x1097-x0310_available.sdf.zip): The top molecules by predicted ic50(nM) after removing compounds not found in Enamine store using Pycule.
